  description: "The Mapping Cancer Markers (MCM) project is a large-scale distributed computing research initiative that utilizes the idle computer resources of volunteers worldwide (World Community Grid) to identify potential biomarkers for intractable cancers such as lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and sarcoma. It is led by the Jurisica Lab at the University of Toronto.",
